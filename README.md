## Introduction

The **Restaurant Management System** is a web application designed to streamline and automate various processes of managing a restaurant. This system helps restaurant owners to manage menus, orders, customers, tables, and staff more efficiently. It is built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** stack, providing a modern and scalable solution.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup system with JWT authentication.
- **Menu Management**: Add, edit, and remove items from the menu.
- **Order Management**: Place, update, and track orders in real-time.
- **Staff Management**: Manage roles and tasks of restaurant staff.
- **Payment Integration**: Support for online payments using payment gateways.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize restaurant performance and sales through charts and reports.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: 
- React.js
- CSS3 and Bootstrap (for styling)
  
**Backend**: 
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (for the database)
- Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
  
**Other Tools**:
- Passport (for user authentication)
- PhonePe API (for payment integration)
- Chart.js or D3.js (for analytics)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4 or higher)
- NPM

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Randip07/miniProject.git
cd restaurant-management-system
```

### Install dependencies:

#### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# JWT Secret Key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# PhonePE API Keys
PAYMENT_SECRET_KEY=your_payment_gateway_key

# Server Port
PORT=5000
```

Make sure to replace placeholders with your actual credentials.

## Usage

### Running the Backend Server
To start the backend server, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Frontend
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Both Simultaneously
For easier development, you can run both the frontend and backend together using concurrently:

1. Install concurrently:
   ```bash
   npm install -g concurrently
   ```

2. Run both servers:
   ```bash
   concurrently "npm run server" "npm run client"
   ```
